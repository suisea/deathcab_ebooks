"I was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere\nWhen the water filled every hole",
"And thousands upon thousands made an ocean\nMaking islands where no islands should go (oh no)",
"Most people were overjoyed; they took to their boats",
"I thought it less like a lake and more like a moat",
"The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your\nDoor have been silenced forevermore",

"If I could open my arms\nAnd span the length of the isle of Manhattan",
"I'd bring it to where you are\nMaking a lake of the east river and Hudson",
"If I could open my mouth\nWide enough for a marching band to march out",
"They would make your name sing\nAnd bend through alleys and bounce off all the buildings",
"I wish we could open our eyes\nTo see in all directions at the same time",
"Oh, what a beautiful view\nIf you were never aware of what was around you",

"As I stared at my shoes in the ICU\nThat reeked of piss and 409",
"And I rationed my breaths as I said to myself\nThat I've already taken too much today",

"Amongst the vending machines and year-old magazines\nIn a place where we only say goodbye",
"It stung like a violent wind that our memories depend\nOn a faulty camera in our minds",
"And I knew that you were a truth I would rather lose\nThan to have never lain beside at all",
"And I looked around at all the eyes on the ground\nAs the TV entertained itself",
"Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room",
"Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room\nJust nervous pacers bracing for bad news",

"Then Labor Day came and went",
"And we shed what was left of our summer skin",
"On the night you left I came over",
"And we peeled the freckles from our shoulders",
"Our brand new coats so flushed in pink",
"And I knew your heart I couldn't win",
"'Cause the seasons' change was a conduit",
"And we left our love in our summer skin",
"So this is the new year\nAnd I don't feel any different",
"The clanking of crystal\nExplosions off in the distance\nIn the distance",

"So everybody put your best suit or dress on\nLet's make believe that we are wealthy for just this once",
"Lighting firecrackers off on the front lawn\nAs thirty dialogues bleed into one",
"I wish the world was flat like the old days\nThen I could travel just by folding a map",
"No more airplanes, or speed trains, or freeways\nThere'd be no distance that can hold us back",
